### Notes
- This template assumes a basic XRP robot base with a differential drive (two motors per side). Adjust motor types, controllers, or microcontroller details based on your team’s setup.
- The code example uses `robotpy` for Python-based programming, common in FRC. Modify for other languages (e.g., C++) or frameworks if needed.
- You can copy this Markdown text into a `.md` file (e.g., `XRP_Robot_Guide.md`) and edit it as needed.
- If you want to add specific details (e.g., team name, custom components, or images), let me know, and I can refine it further!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
